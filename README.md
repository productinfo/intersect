## Installation

Use your package manager of choice to install `@tldraw/intersect`.

```bash
yarn add @tldraw/intersect
# or
npm i @tldraw/intersect
```

## Usage

This library exports many intersection functions. You can use these methods to find intersection points between various 2D shapes. Points are formatted as `[x, y]`.

```tsx
import { intersectLineSegmentEllipse } from "@tldraw/intersect"

const A = [5, 5]
const B = [10, 10]
const ellipse = { center: [10, 10], rx: 5, ry: 4, rotation: Math.PI / 6 }

const intersections = intersectLineSegmentEllipse(
  A,
  B,
  ellipse.center,
  ellipse.rx,
  ellipse.ry,
  ellipse.rotation
)
```

An intersection is formatted as:

```ts
export type TLIntersection = {
  didIntersect: boolean
  message: string
  points: number[][]
}
```

Some intersection functions, such as `intersectLineSegmentLineSegment`, will return a single intersection. Others, such as `intersectRectangleRectangle`, will return an array of several intersections.
